//    On my honor:
//   
//    - I have not discussed the Java language code in my program with
//      anyone other than my instructor or the teaching assistants
//      assigned to this course.
//   
//    - I have not used Java language code obtained from another student,
//      or any other unauthorized source, either modified or unmodified. 
//   
//    - If any Java language code or documentation used in my program
//      was obtained from another source, such as a text book or course
//      notes, that has been clearly noted with a proper citation in
//      the comments of my program.
//   
//    - I have not designed this program in such a way as to defeat or
//      interfere with the normal operation of the Curator System.
