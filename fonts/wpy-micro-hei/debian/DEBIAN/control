Description: 
 WenQuanYi Micro Hei is a Sans-Serif style (also known as Hei, Gothic
 or Dotum among the Chinese/Japanese/Korean users) high quality CJK
 outline font. It was derived from "Droid Sans Fallback" and "Droid
 Sans" released by Google Inc. This font contains all the unified CJK
 Han glyphs in the range of U+4E00-U+9FC3 defined in Unicode Standard
 5.1, together with many other languages unicode blocks, including
 Latins, Extended Latins, Hanguls and Kanas. The font file is
 extremely compact (~4M) compared with most known CJK fonts. As a
 result, it can be used for hand-held devices or embedded systems, or
 used for PC with a significantly small memory footprint.
